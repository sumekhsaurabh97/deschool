            community. All the lessons through the platform are offered by
            independent teachers, who determine the content and format of their
            own lessons.

            themselves no refunds against the cancellation. Once the user/s
            subscribes to any of the one single live session lesson or workshop,
            then irrespective of the student&apos;s attendance or absenteeism
            during the lesson or their cancellation of the subscription for the
            lesson, the platform won&apos;t refund any sort of amount to the

            on a pro-rata basis. For these package lessons, the refund will be
            given to the users only if they cancel their subscription before or
            up to the 2nd lesson of that package of lessons. If the user cancels
            his subscription before or up to the 2nd lesson of any package of
            lessons, then the cost of the consumed lessons and 5% of the total
            fees will be deducted together as cancellation service fees from the
            total subscription fees the user must have paid for the concerned
            package of lessons. However, if the user cancels the subscription of
            any package of lessons post two live lessons, then the platform will
            not offer any refund fees against the cancellation, except in case
            if the platform has offered any refund / cancellation option at the
            time of subscription of the lesson.

            REMEDY IF THE TEACHER / TEACHING COMPANIES DEMANDS FEES OUTSIDE THE
            DESCHOOL PLATFORM
          </h3>

          <p>
            Teachers or Teaching companies, uploading their lessons for sale
            through the platform, have no right, authority and entitlement to
            reach out to the students personally through any / other sort of
            inappropriate means and demand the fees prescribed for the lessons
            personally, keeping the Deschool Online Platform out of the scope.
            Deschool does not tolerate such unprofessional and dishonest acts.
            If any teacher / teaching company behaves in conformity to such
            non-acceptable behaviour, then that will be a serious violation of
            the platform&apos;s T&C.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, this behaviour is potentially dangerous for students
            for the following reasons:
          </p>

          <p>
            (a) Any payment made outside the scope of the platform to the
            teacher / teaching company might risk the user&apos;s payment if the
            teacher / teaching company doesn&apos;t conduct the promised lesson
            sessions. Here, at Deschool Online Platform, the funds are delivered
            to the teachers only when they regularly conduct the lessons as
            promised at the time of the lesson booking.
          </p>

          <p>
            (b) The platform won&apos;t stand responsible for any assurance of
            scheduled lessons and refund or cancellation fees if the users fall
            prey to such illegal / inappropriate demands of the teachers or
            teaching companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            (c) In case of any irregularity on the lesson delivery or any
            dissatisfaction in terms of quality of the lesson delivered by the
            teacher / the teaching company, the platform won&apos;t entertain
            any concerns of the users and no mediation will be available nor the
            platform will be responsible to answer any of the user&apos;s
            concerns, if at all payment of the lesson fees was made to the
            teacher / the teaching company, outside the scope of the platform.
            If a teacher or teaching company asks the student to pay outside of
            the platform, then as a student of the Deschool Online Platform, the
            student should report the teacher or teaching company to
