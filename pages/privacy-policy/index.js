          <p>
            Deschool Online Platform aspires to make skill-based learning
            accessible globally. It is a single platform offering different
            categories of skill-based lessons through its website. The broad
            categories in which the lessons will be offered are - languages,
            technology, arts and health & lifestyle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deschool Online Platform (hereinafter “The Platform”) is established
            with a purpose of building an online learning community that
            provides skill-based lessons to the students across the globe. The
            platform will host teachers /teaching companies from across the
            world and will feature their lessons and workshops. The Platform
            will help them market the lessons and get them students through
            digital marketing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The platform will be a common global platform to connect the
            teachers and the students. The platform will be hosted through a
            website at the outset and the services concerned may be provided
            through a Mobile Application in future.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deschool is a platform where teachers or teaching companies from
            across the globe will offer their lessons suiting their own skills
            and experiences and the users may subscribe to them if they seem
            favourable and beneficial to their needs. Deschool will not
            interfere in the conduct of the lessons as they will be regulated by
            the teachers or teaching companies while being live in the session
            and hence, the platform will just act as a seamless medium for the
            teachers or teaching companies and the students to connect to each
            other and make the objective of &apos;skill-based learning
            accessible globally&apos; realised.
